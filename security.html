                        <p>At MyLastKey, we have built a tool that is secure by design. All processing happens on your device, and no sensitive data is ever sent to us. Our open-source code is a testament to our commitment to transparency and security.</p>
                        
                        <p>However, the ultimate security of your data is a shared responsibility. The security of our tool depends on the security of the environment in which it is used. Therefore, it is important that you, the user, are aware of the following:</p>

                            <p>Ensure your computer or mobile device is free from malware and viruses. A compromised operating system can potentially monitor everything you type.</p>

                            <p>Be critical of the browser extensions (plugins) you install. Some extensions may have permissions to read and alter content on web pages, including the data you enter into MyLastKey.</p>

                            <p>While MyLastKey works offline, be cautious when using it on public Wi-Fi networks. Consider using a VPN or working offline entirely when handling sensitive information.</p>

                            <p>If you choose to save encrypted data files, store them securely and consider multiple backup locations. Remember that losing your Master Key means losing access to your encrypted data permanently.</p>
